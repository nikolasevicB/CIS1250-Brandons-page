  The requirements and gathering stage may be the most important stage in the development process of a software. This is because this is the stage where developers have the 
most interaction with the stakeholders. The goal of the requirements and gathering stage is to lay out all the requirements of the stakeholders making sure that the 
finished product accomplishes these requirements effectively. These crucial details lay the foundation for the rest of the software design process as the remaining stages of
design, implementing, verification and maintaining the software all serve to fulfill these requirements for the stakeholders. Without the requirements and gathering stage, 
developers would be left guessing what the software should do. This may lead to the needs of the stakeholders not being met and potentially making the software obsolete for 
the stakeholders all together. In summary, the requirements and gathering stage is the most important stage of software development because it is the first building block of 
the design process that all other stages build off of. Without the clear requirements communicated directly from the stakeholders of the software, the software would not 
solve the problems of the stakeholders effectively.
