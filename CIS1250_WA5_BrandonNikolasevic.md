One of the most important design principles is principle number 5 which is “Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace”. To me, this is referring to laying out the workload across a fair amount of time instead of compiling it all at once. The reason that this is so important is because compiling all of the workload at once can lead to severe stress or becoming majorly burnt out. This is important in software design as completing a project in a timely manner for the client is very important. Not planning the workload out well or rushing it all at once will lead to a more stressful team environment and ultimately a poorer product. This design principle is important for more than just software development though, an example of where I regret not applying this principle was when I was studying for my discrete structures midterm. I had poorly managed my time leading up to mid term and I cramped many, many hours in a matter of 2 days prior to the exam. The aftermath led to me being severely burned out the coming week of the class resulting in my grade slipping. Another example of why this principle is so important is in the development of a videogame. The player base for a videogame will replay the games contents over and over but eventually will grow bored. Creating a constant stream of new content for them is crucial for the survival of the game. This is why it is important for video game developers to pace themselves so that they can deliver regular content updates without crashing out or underdelivering for the user, enhancing their user experience.
