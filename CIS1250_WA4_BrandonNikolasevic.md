  Communication is crucial for effective software design as it is used throughout the entire development cycle of the software. To start off, there must be effective communication with the shareholder in order to tailor the software to their needs, additionally, communication among developers is important in order to deliver the shareholders needs arcuately as well as in a timely manner. The absence of effective communication can have severe consequences including making  a software that the shareholder doesn't want or the project development having serious delays. 3 elements in effective communication are learning to listen, being open and empathetic as well as being mindful and paying attention. Applying these elements of effective communication will allow you to have a greater understanding of what is being discussed with you allowing you to give the best response that you can. Being able to understand the person you are communicating with will help resolve a multitude of problems before they happen that stem from misunderstandings that could otherwise result in conflict. A personal story of a miscommunication that I had was regarding a group assignment that I had in highschool. I was in a group with 2 people that I didn't know and we were all on the shyer side. Because of this we didn't communicate much between us but rather just briefly divided the work between us. Coming to the due date, me and one of my group members accidentally did the same section leaving a third of the project unfinished. This led to a conflict within my group and us scrambling to finish the other part of the project in time ultimately not doing that well on the project. If I could relive this experience, I would certainly put much more enfances on communicating effectively at the start of the project. The requirements phase in software development, I should have prioritized the initial communication making sure I had a clear understanding of what I needed to do. Additionally, I should have applied some of the communication elements such as being mindful and paying attention. If I had paid closer attention and had been more mindful towards my group members the conflict would have been avoided entirely.
