                                                                            The Notes App
  A software that I use on a daily basis is the notes app on iPhone. This app is well designed for several reasons. The first reason is the problem that It solves. 
Everyone everyday has ideas, tasks or items that they need to remember. Traditionally this problem was solved using a physical notebook and a pencil however this 
leaves much to be desired as a physical notebook and writing utensil was needed on the person. The notes app on iPhone allows for this problem to be solved by 
implementing a digital notebook on a computer that is always carried by the average person allowing anybody to simply note what they need to remember at any time. 
Additionally, the softwareâ€™s design is superior due to its ease of use. Anyone, regardless of their experience with technology can utilise notes in their own lives 
due to its simple and elegant design. The buttons and features are good looking and intuitively designed, allowing users to easily navigate through past notes as 
well as create new ones without any confusion. In essence, the user interface is attractive and intuitive. Continuing, the notes app is well designed because of all
of its features. The notes app not only allows for simple note taking and organisation of past notes, but also allows for the implementation of charts, lists, 
drawings etc to the users notes. This broad spectrum of features allows for users to utilise the app for a variety of purposes. In conclusion, the notes app is a 
software that is well designed due to the problem of notetaking it solves, the ease of use, the apps initiative and attractive user interface and the large number 
of features for more complex notes and tasks.
